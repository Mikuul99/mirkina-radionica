# Mirkina Radionica - A web store for handmade nursery gear

## Brief 

In here, you will find a brief description of the core features of the web app, along with the general ideas for future implementation

### Description

The app was envisioned as a web store that showcases products that had been made for clients at some point in time. The basic idea of the store is to present the features of particular products, while also displaying a wide variety of products that have been made so far since almost none of the products are exactly the same.

## Overview

**_Home-page_**

The home page acts as a warm welcome and a short description of the business. It contains multiple buttons pointing to the shop, along with a form at the bottom which serves as a newsletter sign-up for customers that wish to be kept informed about innovations.

**_Shop_**

The shop section represents the store in its full potential. It serves to display products from the database. The shop consists of the main panel which responsively displays prodcuts, and a side panel which contains a widget for fitlering and sorting the products. The fitler can be set to display prodcuts according to the category, and the sorter can be set to display products in the rising or falling trend in regard to the price, as well as to display the newest products first.

**_Product-page_**

By clicking on a product card in the store, the app displays a detailed product preview. The details are a part of the Product Model and every product has its unique characteristics that are displayed dynamically. These details are in the form of images that can be previewed through an image gallery, and text details displayed below the images.

**_Contact-page_**

In the navigation bar, there are 3 pages that serve as further information to the client and the first one is the contact page. The contact page is a static page that contains closer information on the business like clickable Instagram and Facebook page links as well as the email address and location.
