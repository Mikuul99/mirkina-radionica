# Mirkina Radionica - A web store for handmade nursery gear

## Brief 

In here, you will find a brief description of the core features of the web app, along with the general ideas for future implementation

### Description

The app was envisioned as a web store that showcases products that had been made for clients at some point in time. The basic idea of the store is to present the features of particular products, while also displaying a wide variety of products that have been made so far since almost none of the products are exactly the same.

## Overview

**_Home-page_**

The home page acts as a warm welcome and a short description of the business. It contains multiple buttons pointing to the shop, along with a form at the bottom which serves as a newsletter sign-up for customers that wish to be kept informed about innovations.
